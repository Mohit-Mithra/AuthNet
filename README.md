# Face-Recognition-Systems-with-lip-movement-pattern

Face recognition systems are typically based on a still image of a face picture and comparing it with the previous data to make predictions. The aim of the project is to develop a face recognition model that can strengthen the existing system by making use of facial movement patterns. It involves training the system on videos of the user uttering a predetermined password. Once that is done, the system can identify if a video of a person uttering a word is the correct person saying the correct password or not. 

This can be used as a facial recognition system, where the system “recognises” the right person uttering the right password.
